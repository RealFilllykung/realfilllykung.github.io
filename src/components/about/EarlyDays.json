After playing quite a lot of them, I realize that it is quite boring for just playing video games for the whole day. I have decided to explore more about the computer software by having a look at how people create website at that time. I used to make my own website back then by using one of Adobe product which I don't remember the name of that software already. I found out that it is quite hard back then. When I'm in my high school, I started to study about C++ programming language which is quite a huge jump back then. I made a basic command line program which is quite an eye opening for me to the computer world. On my last year of high school, the last thing I learned from my computer class is Java programming language. This is the language that have inspired me to pursuit to the computer field in the future because it is quite enjoyable to program in Java. I ended up making a simple calculator in that class with GUI interface. After I done that class, I have decided to enroll in Computer Engineering major at Mahidol University International College (MUIC)."
