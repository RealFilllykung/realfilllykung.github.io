    "message" : "It is a time for my college day. I have successfully enrolled into computer engineering major at MUIC. My first programming class starts with C programming language. They taught the basics of programming and memory allocation. It is not quite fun at first sight. After taking the programming courses to programming paradigm, this is what a real fun begins. In that class, the professor makes use of OOP quite a lot by using Java as a programming language. It was quite fun to think in OOP style which I nearly forgets the functional programming for awhile. After I reached my 3rd year, I took a web programming class. This class introduces me to HTML, CSS, and JS. After taking that class, it is like making my childhood dream comes true. I was used to struggle on making a website since I was a child, but after I'm able to make a website by using VueJS, it is quite a fantastic feeling. Now I can see my website up and running in front of my eyes. In addition, I also took a courses about embedded system which learn from basic digital circuit design to using Raspberry Pi for making a project. I remember making a bin that automatically open when people walk passed by. In addition, people can use their phone to locate the bin location by using Line application too!"
